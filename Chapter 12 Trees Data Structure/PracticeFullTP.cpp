/*Write two programs to compare its performance. One program using array data structure and another program using tree
data structure. Random 1000 numbers (ranging from 1 to 1000) and store those number in a file numberRandom.txt . Next
create an array that can store up to 1000 numbers, and create a binary search tree. Read numbers from the file 
numberRandom.txt and add those numbers to the array and the tree (if the number is duplicate, let add it to the right
of the tree).
a- Display data in array. Display data in the tree using inorder traversal.
b- Search for the number 50. Then compare the execution time. Similarly, repeat the search for the number 100, 150, 
and 200
