Comparison between Linear Probing Vs Quadratic Probing:
Linear Probing:
-   faster implementation than quadratic probing
-   use few probes
-   a problem occurs known as primary clustering
-   interval between probes is fixed-often at 1
Quadratic Probing:
-   easy to implement and deploy but slower than Linear Probing
-   use extra memory for links and it does not probe all location in the table.
-   a problem occurs known as secondary clustering
-   interval between probes increases proportional to the hash value.
